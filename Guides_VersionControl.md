#Guides for Version Control 


[TOC]

-----

##What's the Idea:


Version control tools for professional software development are very helpful for us to manage **codes and reports** that are revised frequently. Here, our solution is **Git** and **GitHub**. 

> **The purposes are:**
> 
> - Tracking changes.
> - Allowing parallel developments of various versions for exploring different ideas.
> - Merging and unifying the developments. 
> - Sharing progresses for coherent collaboration.

---

##What you should do:


> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Clone repositories into your computer disk (instruction see below).
> 2. Use the cloned repository as working folder during your work.
> 3. Frequently sync and submit the changes.



**Principles:**

- Keep codes and reports well organized. Organize them according to topics / studies, not by dates. GitHub already keeps tracking the changes by dates. 

- For different tracks of development, you can consider use branches. 

- Do not push too big files to **GitHub**, which restricts each repository under 1Gb. 

- Keep the files in the private repositories of *WPI-Wulab*. No publication of the results (and do not store them into GitHub's public repositories) without Prof Wu's permission.  





##What you should learn? 

### Some instructions for Git and GitHub:


- You can learn **Git** from a [comprehensive introduction][1], or a [simple guide][2]. 

- **Git** is a command-line program, but its most functions can be realized by [GUIs (a lot choices)][3]. 

- You can use **Git** for version control in local repositories, but for sharing and collaboration, the files needs to be stored remotely. We use **GitHub**, which is based on **Git**.

- You can learn **GitHub** based on its [Guides][4] and [Help][5]. 

- **GitHub Desktop** is a good GUI for **Git** and **GitHub**. You can learn it [here][6]. 

- Specially designed for version control of R codes, RStudio also provides a GUI for **Git** and **GitHub**. You can learn [Version Control with Git][7] and [Using Git with RStudio][8].
